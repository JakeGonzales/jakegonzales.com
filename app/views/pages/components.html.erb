<p>See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Put it in, leave it alone. Trees live in your fan <strong>brush, but you have to scare them out</strong>. You can spend all day playing with mountains.<p>
<p>And right there you got an almighty cloud. <a href="#">Son of a gun</a>. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there.</p>

In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature.
