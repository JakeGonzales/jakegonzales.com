      <p>See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Put it in, leave it alone. Trees live in your fan brush, <strong>but you have to scare them out</strong>. You can spend all day playing with mountains.</p>
      <p>And right there you got an almighty cloud. <a href="#">Son of a gun</a>. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there.</p>
      <p>Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs.<i class="fa fa-arrow-down" data-fa-transform="rotate--45"></i></p>
