      <p><abbr title="Kasiana Amara">Kasi</abbr> came to us with this project for the Macquarie University Hospital in Sydney. A small two page website which lead to an EventBrite page to buy tickets. Kasi was imagining a pretty animation heavy design to really bring the invite to life. It was under a pretty short deadline but we were excited so, elbows were greased. We didn't get that many projects that involved animation this heavily so it was a good opportunity to flex some creative muscles.</p>

      <p>Ok so the setup goes a little like this. We had a desktop mockup with a large raster image background. A couple of minor raster image assets and then rest of the items were vectors. One or two things we needed to cut out of the background and fill the background in a little.</p>

      <p>On the first screen some of our instructions were:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The spotlight (on a separate layer) shining down,</li>
        <li>Title to appear &mdash; if possible &mdash; to unravel gradually and glisten/sparkle,</li>
        <li>Each line to appear one after the other like a story being told,</li>
        <li>The key must swing to bring attention to the viewer to "Enter Here".</li>
      </ul>

      <p>And on the second screen:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stars twinkling in the sky,</li>
        <li>If possible to have the fairies moving and stars glistening,</li>
        <li>As per the previous screen: Title to appear &mdash; if possible &mdash; to unravel gradually and glisten/sparkle,</li>
        <li>Butterfly wings moving.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The final requirement was that the two pages needed to be mobile and tablet friendly. Which hopefully wasn't a surprise to anyone.</p>
      <p><abbr title="Adam Gormley">Gorms</abbr> got stuck into the asset cutouts and setups and I got stuck into the build.</p>

      <hr>
    
      <p>I had done a little bit of SVG letter animation before but not with such fine grained control and with such delicate lettering. <abbr title="Adam Gormley">Gorms</abbr> and I worked together to figure out the best paths for animating the SVG which was a great discovery process. The main problem with the paths was the little bit of overlap we would get if we had strokes too big or letters too close.</p>

      <h2>Final Product Pain Points</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Fallbacks not good. No CSS works well, however no JS means it breaks the "Enter Here"</li>
        <li>Terrible accesibility -- which in hindsight is the dumbest thing here because this is for a hospital. We later found out that this was only for doctors but that really didn't make it much better.</li>
        <li>The sparkle animation on the key is definitely a machine overheater when it's active.</li>
        <li>The mobile experience is not that enjoyable, some things can be clicked accidentally.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Pushing the Project Further</h2>
      <p>I was actually hunting to the sparkles as more of a feature over the entire page but since it was terrible for perfomance I only let it show when the key was hovered. It's a shame too because it would have added so much more atmosphere.</p>
