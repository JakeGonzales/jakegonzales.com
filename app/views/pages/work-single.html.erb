              <p>I worked on asset construction, SVG creation, animation, and device friendly layouts.</p>
              <h2>Support</h2>
              <p>Quote, Project Management, and environment support from Michael Congiusta. Fairy animation and typography support from Adam Gormley. Both Adam and I worked on creative direction.</p>

            <p><abbr title="Kasiana Amara">Kasi</abbr> came to us with this project for the Macquarie University Hospital in Sydney. A small two page website which lead to an EventBrite page to buy tickets. Kasi was imagining a pretty animation heavy design to really bring the invite to life. It was under a pretty short deadline but we were excited so, elbows were greased. We didn't get that many projects that involved animation this heavily so it was a good opportunity to flex some creative muscles.</p>

            <p>Ok so the setup goes a little like this. We had a desktop mockup with a large raster image background. A couple of minor raster image assets and then rest of the items were vectors. One or two things we needed to cut out of the background and fill the background in a little.</p>

          <p>On the first screen some of our instructions were:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The spotlight (on a separate layer) shining down,</li>
            <li>Title to appear &mdash; if possible &mdash; to unravel gradually and glisten/sparkle,</li>
            <li>Each line to appear one after the other like a story being told,</li>
            <li>The key must swing to bring attention to the viewer to "Enter Here".</li>
          </ul>

          <p>And on the second screen:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Stars twinkling in the sky,</li>
            <li>If possible to have the fairies moving and stars glistening,</li>
            <li>As per the previous screen: Title to appear &mdash; if possible &mdash; to unravel gradually and glisten/sparkle,</li>
            <li>Butterfly wings moving.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The final requirement was that the two pages needed to be mobile and tablet friendly. Which hopefully wasn't a surprise to anyone.</p>
          <p><abbr title="Adam Gormley">Gorms</abbr> got stuck into the asset cutouts and setups and I got stuck into the build.</p>

          <h2>SVG Text Animation</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="o-l__g-simple">

          <div class="u-space-stack  u-max-width-copy">
            <p>I wanted to tackle this first in the build because to me it seemed like the most involved. I'd just done some SVG text animation so it seemed like the obvious way to go. To start myself off I just applied what I had done with the previous text to see what I could get away with, it wasn't much.</p>
            <p>I was using a CSS animated <code class="c-code-inline">stroke-dashoffset</code> combined with an SVG <code class="c-code-inline">clip-path</code> and this worked really well around the entire outside of a large character. However working with this text was much more difficult because the text was thin, there were a lot of tight turns, and the text was close together. The clip path would end up showing on the return route along the other side of the letter and ruined the hand writing effect I'd imagined; kind of a double drawing.</p>

            <p>So the solution it would seem was to only have one path for the drawing and to cut away the other sides of the characters where it was problematic.</p>
            <p><abbr title="Adam Gormley">Gorms</abbr> and I worked together to figure out the best paths for animating the SVG which was a great discovery process. The main problem with the paths was the little bit of overlap we would get if we had strokes too big or letters too close.</p>
            <p>In the end we decided to leave this because it wasn't very obvious and we couldn't come up with a better solution fast enough.</p>

        <h2>Final Product Pain Points</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Fallbacks not good. No CSS works well, however no JS means it breaks the "Enter Here"</li>
          <li>Terrible accesibility -- which in hindsight is the dumbest thing here because this is for a hospital. We later found out that this was only for doctors but that really didn't make it much better.</li>
          <li>The sparkle animation on the key is definitely a machine overheater when it's active.</li>
          <li>The mobile experience is not that enjoyable, some things can be clicked accidentally.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Pushing the Project Further</h2>
        <p>I was actually hunting to the sparkles as more of a feature over the entire page but since it was terrible for perfomance I only let it show when the key was hovered. It's a shame too because it would have added so much more atmosphere.</p>
